#### Network Security

Pre-lecture
- Be sure to submt Labs *per instructions*. She will take points off otherwise.
  - i.e. if she asks for a word document, subm
- Searching for answers is encouraged, and even referencing Stack Overflow is good practice.
  - This does not apply for tests, obviously.
- When you work in a team...
  - make sure everyone's name is on an in-class worksheet
  - Only *one* copy needs to be submitted

## The Superuser

`su` - Superuser
- access the superuser shell

`sudo` - Superuser do
- runs any *single* command as a superuser
- Sudo asks for the **administrator** password (cross-reference this information)

`sudo su -`
- lets you run any further commands with root access
- "This is a big liability." - Dr. X
- From the manual:  
  "When `-` is used, it must be specified before any username. For portability it is recommended to use it as last option, before any username. The other forms (-l and --login) do not have this restriction."

## Password (cont.2)

Ways to authenticate
- Who we are
- What we know
- What we have

### Who we are - Biometrics
- Fingerprint, iris
- "Windows Hello", DNA?

***Confusion Matrix***

```
      Detection Result
          T        F
     +--------+--------+
R    |  True  |  False |
e  T |Positive|Negative|
a    |        |        |
l    +--------+--------+
i    |  False |  True  |
t  F |Positive|Negative|
y    |        |        |
     +--------+--------+
```

False Negatives are an *annoyance/inconvenience*

False Positives are a serious ***danger***
- breach of confidentiality

### In-class example

Fingerprint sensor
- calibrated to look for width >= 5  
  "Anything greater than 5 unlocks the phone."

Owner readings:  
4.3, 5.1, 4.8, 3.0, 5.5, 6.5

Attacker:  
3.0, 2.0, 1.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0

**Calibrating the threshold**

|Thresholds |4|5|6|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| TP | 5 | 3 | 1 |
| FP | 3 | 2 | 1 |
| TN | 3 | 4 | 5 |
| FN | 1 | 3 | 5 |

<br/>

***Rating the positives***

We want to maximize the true positives and minimize the false positives. We can do that by comparing the following ratios:
- TPR = TP / (FN + TP)
- FPR = FP / (FP + TN)

### Read the book for Specificity, Sensitivity, Accuracy

## Chapter 2.2 - Access Control

### Definitions

- ***Access Control (AC)***
  - Limiting who can access what
- ***AC Subjects***
  - human users or programs
- ***AC Objects***
  - files, tables, programs, memory objects, hardware devices, strings, data fields, network connections, etc.
- ***Access modes***
  - controllable actions
- ***Access policies***
  - higher-level security pilicy that drives the AC

Access control is heavily inspired by military practice, "need to know"

***Effective implementation***
- check every acces
- enforce least priviledge
  - default user should have minimum access
  - start giving access as needed
- verify acceptable usage

### Tacking

Access logs
- audit logs
- system files
- Examples:
  - Linux command: `history`
- Rule of thumb:
  - "Log as much as you can"
  - implement logs in normal programs for security and safety

Granualirity
- "How much is too much?"
- Forensics vs Performance

### Implementing Acces Control

Types of implementation
- ***Reference Monitor***
  - AC that is always invoked, tamperproof, and verifiable
    - validates every access attempd
    - immune from tampery
    - assuredly correct
  - issues
    - single access point
    - performance
      - could be overwhelmed
- ***AC Directory***
  - See example below
  - issues
- ***AC Matrix***
  - similar to AC Directory
  - much more efficient on size
- ***AC Lists***
  - much more dynamc structure

<br/>

***AC Directory example***

| File name | Access rights | file pointer |
|-|-|-|
|F|ORWX|0x00000000|
|BIBLIOG|ORW|0x00000000|
|PROGLC|ORW|0x00000000|

***AC Matrix Example***

| |Afile|Bfile|Cfile|Dfile|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Anna|rwx|r|x||
|Bill|r|rx|x||
|Charles|r|r|rw|r|
