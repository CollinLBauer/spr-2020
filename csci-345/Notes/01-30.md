## Modern Cryptography

*"What's the difference between encoding and encryption?"*
- Encrpyiton makes a message disguised/unrecognizable
  - phrase & secret key
- Encoding translates between languages (human/machine) so it may be understood by machines
  - ASCII, Unicode

*What does crypto help us with?*
- confidentiality
- integrity
- authenticity

<br/>

### Secret Key Crypto

```
       message              encrypted message             message
Alice --------> [Encrypt] --------------------> [decode] --------> Bob
                    |               |               |
                  (key)             |             (key)
                                   Eve
```

Without the key, Eve cannot decrypt the encrypted message.

### Kerckhoff's Principles

Kerckhoff's principles are contrary to the princeple of "security by obscurity", which relies only upon the secrecy of the algorithm/cryptosystem
- If security of a keyless algorithm becomes compromised, cryptosystem

- Modern crypto systems use a key to control encryption and decryption
- Ciphertext should be undecipherable without the correct key
- Encryption key may be different from decryption key
- ***Kerckhoff's principles*** [1883]
  - Assume Eve knows the cipher algorithm
  - Security should rely on choice of key
  - If Eve discovers the key, a new key can be chosen

## Block Ciphers vs Stream Ciphers


### Stream Ciphers
- useful when plaintext arrives as a stream
- vulnerable if used incorrectly

### Xor attack???

<blockquote style="font-size:1.2em;">
E(M) = M ⊕ C(k)
</blockquote>

What if the same key is used twice?

<blockquote style="font-size:1.2em;">
E(M<sub>1</sub>) = M<sub>1</sub> ⊕ C(k)<br/>
E(M<sub>2</sub>) = M<sub>2</sub> ⊕ C(k)<br/>
<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; E(M<sub>1</sub>) ⊕ E(M<sub>2</sub>)<br/>
= M<sub>1</sub> ⊕ M<sub>2</sub> ⊕ C(k)<br/>
= M<sub>1</sub> ⊕ M<sub>2</sub> ⊕ 0<br/>
= M<sub>1</sub> ⊕ M<sub>2</sub><br/>
</blockquote>

<br/>

### Substitution attack

"Man in the middle"

Known: E(M) and M

<blockquote style="font-size:1.2em;">
E'(M) = E(M) ⊕ M'<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= M ⊕ C(k) ⊕ M' ⊕ M<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= 0 ⊕ C(k) ⊕ M'<br/>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;= E(M')
</blockquote>

### Block Encryption

- Converts one input plaintext block of fixed size b bits to an outputciphertext block also f *b* bits
-Beenefits of large b? short b?

<br/>

### Block Ciphers

- Feistel Cipher
- DES - Data Encryption Standard
- AES - Advanced Encryption Standard

DES was popular up until 2015, but it was cracked way back in 1998!

Variants of DES
- DESX
- Triple DES

#### AES
- International NISTbakeoff between cryptographers
  - Rijndael
- Replaced DES

New algortihms are being looked for today, especially with quantum computing on the horizon.

*I really hope that these diagrams won't be on any tests because holy hell this is ridiculous.*

??????????

Transpositon --> confusion  
Substitution --> dilution
