## Network Security

This is the first time I've took notes since wee switched to prerecorded lectures. I was pretty discouraged from taking notes for the last couple of weeks. Time to get back on it, I guess.

## Malware

Well-known malware types include:
- ***viruses***
- ***worms***
  - self-propogating programs
- ***trojans***
  - malicious code hiding in benign files and programs
  - very commonly spread through email
- ***ransomware***
  - software that locks down a computer until the user pays a "ransom"
  - typically encrypts files on the host computer  
  - often targeted towards universities, government entitties, etc.
- ***spyware/adware***
  - spies on what users do; forces them to visit certain sites
  - extremely common

### A brief history

Malware is spread through many different means, including:
- through external devices, such as disk drives and USB drives.
- via "phishing" emails
- websites and advertisements which force the user to download malicious data

Malware can also infect enterprise systems and mobile devices!

**Early viruses**
- Morris Worm
  - developed by Robert Morris, then-student at MIT
  - self-propogated to other computers, infecting entire internet at the time
- Melissa Worm
  - spread through Microsoft Outlook
  - contained a word .doc that opened porn websites and then emailed itself to victim's contacts
- iloveyou (Love letter)
  - disguised as a love letter
  - accesses OS and storage
- and many others

### Zero-day Malware
- A ***Zero-day*** malware is a malware that has just been discovered and that there is no security patch available for.

### Malware features
- goal: cause harm in some way or another
- transmission & propogation: how it spreads
- activation: malware that is only active when the creator wants it to be
  - it may look for a certain program to start, certain data to be exposed, or an activation command from its creator
- stealth: the ability for the malware to stay hidden
  - stealth properties: 
    - installation
    - execution
    - storage
  - methods of stealth include hiding in memory, trojan malwares, rootkits and more.

## Secure Coding


### OWASP Secure Coding Guiadelines

*You'll rememember them from the juice Shop homework.*

1. Input validation
2. Output encoding
   - bytes vs ASCII vs UTF-8, etc.
   - helps with protocol and funcitonal errors
3. Authentication and password management
   - How do we properly save passowrds?
4. Session management
5. Access control
6. Cryptographic practices
7. Error handling and logging
   - helps pinpoint bugs/security issues
8. Data protection
   - encryption, etc.
9. Communication security
10. System configuration
11. Database security
12. File management
13. Memory management
14. General coding practices

## Operating System Security

***Operating System*** the fundamental controller of all computer system resources

### Boot time
- initiates all primitive funcitons needed for the system to operate
- loads more complex functions over time
- note: antivirus and firewalls are slow to start, thus do not protect the operating system itself.

There are different Operating Systems, but you already know about this.

### OS Security Features
- Enforced sharing
  - making resources available as appropriate
  - (everything is not always available to everyone)
- Inter-process communication
  - synchronizing recource access
  - mediating access based on AC data
- Protection of critical OS data
  - RWX permissions, etc.
- Guaranteed fair service
  - task scheduling
- Interface hardware
  - fair access to hardware resources
  - clocks, AC tables
- User authentication
  - large feature of operating systems
  - passwords, biometrics, etc.
- Memory protection
  - protect from unauthorized access, i.e. arbitrary code execution
- File and I/O device access control
- Allocation and access control to general objects
  - abstractions that provide additional protetcion, such as TLBs

### Brief history

| generation | years | notes
|-|-|-|
| 1st | 1940 - 1955 | early OSes, vaccuum tube, single user |
| 2nd | 1955 - 1965 | job scheduling, faster I/O, spooling, batch files |
| 3rd | 1965 - 1980 | shared processing, multiprograming, virtual memory |
| recent | 1980 - today | distributed computing, PCs, high-speed communication, multi-media |

### Modern OS techniques

**Layering**
- Layered Authentication
**OS Modules**
