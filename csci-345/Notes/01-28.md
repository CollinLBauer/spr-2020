## Network Security

### HW1 due next week
- Testing: generate your own hashes
  - save password as file
  - `sha256sum /path/to/file`
  - check your code against resulting hash

"No free rides"
- labs will not be accepted if teams don't collaborate and trade off work
  - "Communicate!"
- Flags
  1. ???
  2. If she sees some differences between performance in test & performance in assignment
  3. She doesn't share all of her methods (but also it shouldn't be an issue for us so...)

*Rambles were a little long today.*

## Secret Key Cryptography

"Why is crypto useful"
- networks designed for data transport not for data confidentiality or privacy
- Internet eavesdroppingis (relatively) easy
- enables:
  - e-commerce and e-banking
  - confidential messaging
  - digital identities
  - protection of personal data
  - *electronic voting (maybe)*
  - anonymity

<br/>

### History

~ 4000 year old discipline
- Egyptians use of non-standard hieroglyphics
- Spartans used scytale to perform transposition cipher
- Italion Leon Batista Alberti invents polyalphabetic ciphers in 1466

***The Enigma Machine***
- German WWII encryption device
- Used polyalphabetic substitution cipher
- broken by Allied forces (Alan Turing)
- Intelligence called Ultra
- Codebreaking at Bletchley Park
- See original at the Internaitonal Spy Museum

<br/>

*Terminology*
- **Cyryptosystem**
  - method of disguising (encrpypting) plaintext messages to that only select parties can decipher the ciphertext
- **Cryptography**
  - the art/science of developing and using crpytosystems
- **Cryptoanalysis**
  - a
- a
  - a

### Cryptography and Security

- *"Cryptography isn't the solution to security"*
  - buffer overflows, worms, viruses, trojan horses, SQL injection, corss-site scripting, bad programming practices, etc.

- Idion: "Noone ever got fired for using AES"

#### Historical crypto algorithms
- Caesar cipher
  - shift each letter in the alphabet by a static value
  - values wrap around the alphabet
- Substitution cipher
  - take a letter, substitute it with another letter in the alphabet
  - form a full set of replacement letters with a "ciphertext alphabet"
  - *Enigma Machine did a combination of this and polyalphabetic*
- Polyalphabetic cipher
  - works like a caesar cipher, but with multiple shift values depending on the location of the character in the text and the "key"
  - *Vigenere*
- One time pads
  - generate a random substitution cipher for every day
  - *Also used by Germany*

### Cryptanalysis

Goal: learn the key

Classifications:
- **ciphertext-only** attack
  - Eve has acess only to ciphertext
- **known-plaintext** attack
  - Eve has access to plaintext and corresponding ciphertext
- **chosen-plaintext** attack
  - Eve can choose plaintext and learn ciphertext
- **chosen-ciphertext** attack
  - Eve can choose ciphertex and learn plaintext
