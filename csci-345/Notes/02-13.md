**_______ Protocol**
- Standard way of sending and receiving information

## Encapsulation

Application program
| | | | | |
|-|-|-|-|-|
|||| TCP header | Application data |
|||| TCP header | Application data |
|||| TCP header | Application data |
|||| TCP header | Application data |

## Why layers?

Goals
- low coupling
- high cohesion

***URL*** - Uniform Resource Locator
- host name (or IP)
- path name

Dufferent online models
- Client-server
  - basically any website
  - web services
- Peer-to-peer
  - Napster (lol)
  - Vidyagames (in some contexts)
  - Torrenting
  - *Blockchain*

**TCP** - Transmission Control Protocol
- TCP flow
  - client initiates connection to socket
  - server accepts connection
  - HTTP messages exchanged
  - TCP connection closed

**HTTP** - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
- HTTP is *stateless*
  - server maintains to information about past client requests
- Non-persistent HTTP flow
  - client initiates HTTP
  - request sent
  - server responds
  - connection closed
  - repeat for every element needed
- persistent HTTP flow
  - server leaves conneciton open
  - ...
  - See her slides for more details, I guess.




### Ohhh wireshark...

### Something about 

**Cookies** - invention to keep states for HTTP
- Made for eCommerce
- designed to keep track of data between session
- plain text; may be interpreted by each web server differently
- may be used maliciously


### DNS - Domaion Name System
- *distributed database* implemented in hierarchy of many *name servers*
- ...

DNS services
- hostname to IP address translation
- host aliasing
  - canonical, alias names
- mail server aliasing
- load distribution
  - replicated Web servers:  
    many IP addresses correspond to one name
- *why not centralize?*

       (~~~~~Root DNS servers~~~~~)
       /            |             \
     /              |               \

### DNS Records

Yeah just look at the slides, holy crap.

Other protocols
- SMTP
- FTP/SFTP
- SSH
