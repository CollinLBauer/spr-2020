## Finding the Shortest Path

What algorithms to use?
- Intranets generally use Dijkstra's
- Internet uses Distance-Vector

### Dijkstra's Algorithm

*This algorithm is taught in CSCI 230 and MATH 307.*

See slides for example network topology

|Step 0|N'|p(v)|p(x)|p(y)|p(z)|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| 0 | u | 7,u | 3,u | 5,u | ∞ | ∞ |
| 1 | uw | 6,w |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |

Note: The network updates its connection weights every now and then, which causes the algorithm to rerun. This takes time, which is why it only happens occasionally.

### Distance-Vector Algorithm

*This algorithm is taught in CSCI 310.*

| Node X table | X | Y | Z |
|-|-|-|-|
| X |  |  |  |
| Y | ∞ | ∞ | ∞ |
| Z | ∞ | ∞ | ∞ |

## Network Security

[slides](../Book/slides/10_ComputerNetworkSecurity.pptx)

### Outline
- Computer Network Threat Model
- Protocol Insecurities
- DDoS
- Wireless
- Defences: TLS, Firewalls, IDS, IPS


## Network Threats

- Eavesdropping
  - threatens Confidentiality
- Data corruption
  - sequencing
  - substitution
  - insertion
  - replay
    - pretending to be someone else
  - trheatens Integrity
- Interruption
  - DoS attacks
  - threatens Availabiity


### Eavesdropping

Methods
- Elevated priviledges
- Libpcap/Winpcap
- Pcap/Pcapng

Side channel (hardware-based attacks)
- radiation
- cable splicing

See slides for more details and graphics.
