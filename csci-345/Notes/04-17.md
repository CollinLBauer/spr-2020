### Protection tools

- Audit logs
  - record incidents that occur
  - good for post-analysis
- Virtualization
  - Virtual Machines & Hypervisor
  - Sandbox
    - container for a program
    - program cannot see resources outside the sandbox89
  - Honeypot
    - conceptual idea; attracts network data and away from more sensitive systems
- Separation and Sharing
  - physical
    - cannot access resources that are not connected together!
  - temporal
    - resources only available in certain time window
  - logical
    - only have a program see data necessary for its execution
    - exception is commonly used data, which may be shared between processes
  - cryptographic
    - encrypted data that is hard to decypher

### Hardware protection of memory

- Fencing
  - Separation of memory into different sectors
    - Operating System
    - User space
  - 
    - Address Range
    - Address Limit Register
