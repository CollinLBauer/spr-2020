### Midterm review

http://mountrouidoux.people.cofc.edu/CSCI345/docs/MidtermReview_S20.pdf

1. Security Mindset
   - CIANA
     - Confidentiality
     - Integrity
     - 
     - Non-
     - Availability
   - Asymmetric advantage
2. IDK man look at the guide

From discussion
- She mentioned needing to know layers 5 and 4 of Networking, but not layer 3

## The five-layer stack

```
  +--------------+
5 | Application  |
  |--------------|
4 | Transport    |
  |--------------|
  |Network       |
  |--------------|
2-|              |
  |--------------|
1 | Physical (bits)

## Layer 4


### Transport vs Network layer
- Network layer: logical communication between ***hosts***
- Transport layer: logical communication between ***processes***
  - relies on, enhances, network layer services

### Transport Control Protocol (TCP)
- reliable, in-order delivery
- congestion control
- flow control
- ...

### Multiplaxing

*multiplexing at sender*
- handle data from multiple sockets, add transport header (later used for demux)

*demultiplexing at receiver*
- use header info to deliver received

***how demuxing works***
- host receives IP datagrams
  - each datagram has source IS address, destination IP address
  - each diagram carries one transport-layer segment
  - each segment has source, destination port number
- host uses *IP addresses & port numbers* to direct segment to appropriate socket

**Address 4-tuple**
- (IP<sub>src</sub>, Port<sub>src</sub>, IP<sub>google</sub>,443)
- 

Logical ports
- 0-1024 are standardized
- \>1024

### UDP - User Datagram Protocol

<br/>

### Three-way Handshake
1. SYN
   - Client opens connection
   - sends request
2. SYN-ACK
   - Server receives request
   - sends acknowledgement & information
3. ACK
   - Client receives acknowledgement
   - sends confirmation acknowledgement
