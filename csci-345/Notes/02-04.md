## Confusion vs Diffusion

*errata from last class*

### [Outside resource](https://techdifferences.com/difference-between-confusion-and-diffusion.html)

| Basis for Comparison | Confusion | Diffuson |
|-|-|-|
| Basic | Utilized to generate vague cipher texts | Utilized to generate obscure, plain texts |
| Seeks to | Make a relation between statistics of the ciphertext and the value of the encrpytion key as complicated as pssible | The statistical relationship between the plaintext and ciphertext is made as complicated as possible |
| Achieved through | Substitution algorithm | Transposition algorithm |
| Used by | Block cipher only | Stream cipher and block cipher|
| Results in | Increased vagueness | Increased redundancy |


WiFi encryption uses *stream ciphers*

key reuse
substitution

Cipher function C(k)
Encryption
- C = key XOR initial value

Block Ciphers
- DES
  - DESX
  - Triple DES
- AES

idk.

### Questions about block ciphers

4. How many different permutations are there over 128-bits (for a 128-bit cipher)?
   - 2<sup>128</sup>
5. How many different

## Pulic Key Cryptography

*Private-key crypto is loke a door lock.*
- You need a key.
- If someone wants to unlock the door, they need that key.  
  *(Think of breaking the crypto like printing a duplicate key)*

The internet is an open medium, and keys may be intercepted, so private keys

### Diffie-Hellman key exchange
- Turing award winners, 2015
- intruduced the idea of a "common paint"

**The "Common Paint" concept**
![](./images/commonpaint.png)

Assume *g*, *p* are known publicly
|Alice| |Bob|
|-|-|-|
|a, g, p | | b |
|A = g<sup>a</sup> `mod` p | ─<sup>1</sup>[ g, p, A ]─> | B = g<sup>b</sup> `mod` p
| | | |
| K = B<sup>a</sup> `mod` p | <─<sup>2</sup>[ B ]─ | K = A<sup>b</sup> `mod` p

K = A<sup>b</sup> mod p = (g<sup>a</sup> mod p )<sup>b</sup> mod p = g <sup>ab</sup> mod p = (g<sup>b</sup>

Variable names
- g ─ "generator" - prime number
- p ─ also a prime number
- A ─ Alice's message to Bob
- B - Bob's message to Alice

***Prime numbers make the best keys.***

<br/>

### RSA (Rivest, Shamir, Adelman) Algorithm
- Alice uses Bob's public key to send a message
- Bob decrpyts it using his priavte key.
- A: (priv<sub>A</sub>, pub<sub>A</sub>)  
- B: (priv<sub>B</sub>, pub<sub>B</sub>)

E(M) = M<sup>Pub<sub>B</sub></sup> mod N = C  
D(M) = C<sup>Priv<sub>B</sub></sup> mod N = C

Note that some variations of RSA inverse the key's usages. Not sure why.
