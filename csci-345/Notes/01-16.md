## LECTURE MATERIAL

### Identification vs Authentication

What is the difference?
- "Who are you?"
- "Are you who you say you are?"

Why is it important?
- access control
...
- Security and privacy
- "You don't want your identity stolen"

Which one should be private? Which should be public? Why?
- ID is public
- Authentification is private

Authentification examples
- passwords
- genetic identifiers


### Problems with passwords

From discussion
- cannot possibly remember hundreds
- passwords can be too difficult to remember
- passwords can be too short or common, thus easy to steal
- password rules lead to leaking information on the password
- insecure password storage
- not unique to person

From powerpoint
- use
- disclosure
- revocation
- loss
  - Note: There is always a way to change a password, but never a way to retrieve it.

Password vulnerabilities
- no password
- same as UID
- from common list
  - contained in a short college dictionary
  - contained in complete Engish word list
  - contained in common non-English-language dictionaries
  - contained in short college disctionary with capitalizations, substitutions, etc.
  - contained in complete English dictionary and capitalizatitons, substitutions, etc

### What makes a good password

***Entropy***
- the average (expected) amount of the information from the event

<p style="font-size: 1.5em">E = sum<sup>m</sup><sub>i=1</sub>(p<sub>i</sub> log<sub>b</sub>(p<sub>i</sub>))</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.5em">I = - log<sub>b</sub>(p<sub>i</sub>)</p>

Shannon - Information Theory

<br/>

***Comic example***, Trobubador

Trobubador
- uncommon word
- library of uncommon words: ~65000
- I = 16 bits

Is the first letter capitalized?
- I = 1 bit

Substitutions?
- three potential substitutions
- I = 3 bits

Single punctuation
- I = 4 bits

Single digit
- I = 3 bits

Order of dangling elements
- I = 1 bit

Total information = 28


***Comic example***, Passphrase
Four comm

Entropy is objective, but 

### How NOT to store a password

- Plain text (duh)
- Encryption (is reversible)
- Hashing alone (irreversible, not good enough I guess?)
