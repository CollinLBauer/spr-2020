## Network Security

### Midterm review

1. **Biometrics Threshold**
   - Multiple thresholds were required (you did a bunch)
   - "As long as you used 3 thresholds and justified your choice you were fine."
   - The example threshold was imperfect but good.

2. (2 a) **Stream cipher** 
   1. algorithm known; key unknown
      - *"If you have the key, don't break the door down!"*
      - Algorithm
        - E(M) = m XOR K
        - K = {0,1}
      - Two known attacks:
        1. Key reuse
           - E(M<sub>1</sub>) XOR E(M<sub>2</sub>) = M<sub>1</sub> XOR M<sub>2</sub>
        2. Substitution
           - E(M') = ... = M' XOR K
   2. algorithm unknown
      - Brute force, apparently? You got it right?
   3. "The only way this algorithm can be safe is if all of the messages are a single bit."
      - You were really close; you said two bits.

3. (2 b) **Number of keys to exchange**  
   i. 30 x 29  
   ii. Either 0 or 30 (depends on rationale)

3. **Entropy**
   - Entropy calculations
     1. E<sub>p</sub> = 2log(1/6500) + 8log(1/2000) + 3log(1/8) + 10log(1/2) log(1/16) = 132
     2. ??
     3. 30
   - Answers
     1. First password is best based on calculations
     2. NIST standards said monkey I think

4. DNS Query
   - Recursive answer...
   -  mine.ja.net --> dns1.ja.net --> root DNS --> TLD *.com --> *.foobar.com --> Authroitative yours.foobar.com --> all the way back up

5. Protocols
   - a)
     - IP<sub>src</sub> = B
     - IP<sub>dst</sub> = A
     - port<sub>src</sub> = y
     - port<sub>dst</sub> = x
   - b) 1000 sockets, something something...

Somehow you got a 94. Take it where you get it I guess.

## Web Application security (chapter 4)

*slides from the Stanford Web security group*

Two "huge" attacks
1. SQL Injection
2. XSS - Cross-site scripts

### Web Applications
- Huge trend: software as a Web-based service
- Applications hosted on Web servers
- Security is rarely the main concern *<sub><sup>(tsk tsk)</sup></sub>*

Aside: waht are web apps made of?
- Front end:
  - appearance: HTML, CSS
  - code: JavaScript mostly
- Backend:
  - Code: NodeJS (JavaScript), RoR (Ruby), Apache (Java), Django (Python), many more...

<br/>

Buncha skipped slides later...

### SQL
- Widely-used database query language
- fetch a set of records  
  `SELECT * FROM person WHEREUsername='Vitaly'`
- Add data to the table  
  `INSERT INTO Key (Username, Key), VALUES ('Vitaly', 3611BBFF)`
- Modify data  
  `UPDATE Keys SET Key=FA33452D WHERE PersonID=5`
- Querty syntac (mostly) independent of vendor

**SQL Injection is the #1 web vulnerability in the past ten years.**
- OWASP is a non-profit dedicated to studying and countering these vulnerabilities.

**SQL injection example**
- This really simple example will erase all databases on an unprotected SQL-based web database.
```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│            ┌────────────────┐   │
│  Username: │user;DROP ALL DATABASES;--
│            └────────────────┘   │
│            ┌────────────────┐   │
│  Password: │                │   │
│            └────────────────┘   │
│                                 │
│                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

SELECT ..... username=?
