## Passwords (cont)

<sub>*from last class*</sub>

### How NOT to store a password

- Plain text (duh)
- Encryption (is reversible)
- Hashing alone (needs something more))

Rehashing from 230...
- take key
- convert to ASCII
- add numbers toether
- mod by size of array

**Hashing a password**

Hashing passwords requires much more complicated algorithms.

Good hash functions have
- speed
- "avalanche effect"
  - take a password, i.e. "12345"
  - flip a single bit
  - new password totally unrecognizable
- pigeonhole principle *Hey I remember this mess!"
  - If you have n holes and n + 1 objects to put in these holes, there will be at least one hole with > 1 objects inside.
  - Referred to as "collisions"
  - good hash functions avoid collisions

### Password Attacks

Possible ways to crack passwords
- Guess
- Dictionary
  - unhashed set of words
  - hash each inividual word & compare
- Rainbow tables
  - pre-hashed table of passwords and hashes according to function
  - saves time by skipping hash


  ### Password protection

  - Make a better password... please
  - Do not reuse passwords
  - Store proerly: hash + salt + pepper
  - use a strong hashing algorithm
    - "Espectially not MD5 or SHA1!"

  Password managers are a strong option.

***Better passwords***

- Increase entropy
  - If youhave a 42 bit password, what should bea proper way to choose these bits?
    Hint Think about a coin toss
- NIST guidelines
  - Use characters other than just a-z
  - Choose a long password
  - Avoid actual names or words
  - Use a string you canremmber (use an algorithm, password manager)
  - ~~Use variants for multiple passwords~~ has been revised
  - ~~Change passwords regularly~~ has been revised
  - Do not write it down
  - Do not tell anyone

*Think: How do the NIST criteria increase the entropy?*

***Salt and pepper***

***Salt*** - extra piece of information added to a password, stored in a separate file than your `/etc/shadow/password`
- Date
- Username
- Random

***Pepper*** - Not stored secret, may be defined by application
- relatively new concept

Dictionaries may still attack salted passwords, but need to brute force the salt.

### Hash functions

***Hash function***  
deterministic one-way function that takes as input an arbitrary message M (sometimes called a *preimage*) and returns an output (M)


***Common hash functions***
- MD5 (128-bit)
- SHA-1 (160-bit)
- SHA-256 (256-bit)
- SHA-512 (512-bit)
- SHA-3 (relatively new; bit size varies)

Q: *If a message is only 32 bits, how do we extend it to 256?*  
A: ***Padding***

*See diagrams from class slides*


### Why are hashes useful?

1. Message authentication codes (MACs):
  - e.g. MAC(M) = h(K|M)  
  (but use HMAC instead)
2. Modification detection codes:
  - detect modification of data
  - any change in data will cause change in hash

## Biometrics for authentication

- Fingerprint
- Hand geometry
- Retina and iris
- Voice
- Handwriting
- Typing characteristcs
- Blood vessels in the finger of the hand
- face
- Facial features

I've noticed that my line of thinking often differs from the line of thinking we focus on in class.
- i.e. for integrity of software, I brought up one-wayness of the hash from an efficiency standpoint, and while compressed hashes will be inherently one-way, this is more inherently were
