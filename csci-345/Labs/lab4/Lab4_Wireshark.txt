Lab 5
Part 1
1. Is your browser running HTTP version 1.0 or 1.1? What version of HTTP is the server
running?
    Our browser and the server is running version 1.1 of HTTP.

2. What languages (if any) does your browser indicate that it can accept to the server?
    en-US and en (US English and Standard English)

3. What is the IP address of your computer? Of the gaia.cs.umass.edu server?
    Computer: 10.5.204.226
    Server: 128.119.245.12

4. What is the status code returned from the server to your browser?
    200

5. When was the HTML file that you are retrieving last modified at the server?
    Mon, 24 February 2020 06:59:04 GMT

6. How many bytes of content are being returned to your browser?
    128 bytes

7. By inspecting the raw data in the packet content window, do you see any headers within
   the data that are not displayed in the packet-listing window? If so, name one.
    No, all headers are there.

Part 2

1. What is the IP address and TCP port number used by the client computer (source) that is
   transferring the file to gaia.cs.umass.edu? To answer this question, it’s probably easiest
   to select an HTTP message and explore the details of the TCP packet used to carry this
   HTTP message, using the “details of the selected packet header window” (refer to Figure
   2 in the “Getting Started with Wireshark” Lab if you’re uncertain about the Wireshark
   windows.
    Client IP: 10.5.204.226
    Client Port: 56258

2. What is the IP address of gaia.cs.umass.edu? On what port number is it sending and
   receiving TCP segments for this connection?
    Gaia IP: 128.119.245.12
    Gaia Port: 80

3. What is the IP address and TCP port number used by your client computer (source) to
   transfer the file to gaia.cs.umass.edu?
    Client IP: 10.5.204.226
    Client Port: 56258

4. What is the sequence number of the TCP SYN segment that is used to initiate the TCP
   connection between the client computer and gaia.cs.umass.edu? What is it in the segment
   that identifies the segment as a SYN segment?
    Sequence Number: 152515
    There is a specific bit in the sequence that acts as a flag specifying the segment as a SYN segment.

5. What is the sequence number of the SYNACK segment sent by gaia.cs.umass.edu to the
   client computer in reply to the SYN? What is the value of the Acknowledgement field in
   the SYNACK segment? How did gaia.cs.umass.edu determine that value? What is it in
   the segment that identifies the segment as a SYNACK segment.
    Sequence Number: 1
    Ack: 152961
    The SYN value of 1 indicates that gaia.cs.edu successfully received the request. The ACK number comes
      from our original SYN number and adding the segment length (446) to it.
    There is a specific bit in the sequence that acts as a flag specifying the segment as a SYNACK segment.
