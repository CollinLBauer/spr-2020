## Answers to Software Engineering Ethics Parts 6-8 & appendicies

> My answers may get a rather personal. These are personal questions, and It's hard to talk morals from a neutral perspective.

### Q. 6.1
#### Of these five moral habits and practices, which do you think you are best at presently? Which of these habits, if any, would you like to do more to cultivate?

> Of the five habits mentioned above, the one I do the most by far is self-reflection. This is partly due to low self-esteem, but that has ironically led me to always think I can be better. It has taken me from being a college dropout to sitting in this very class, so that's something, right?
> 
> In contrast, I often (as the reading puts it) neglect to acknowledge my moral strengths. I frequently get sucked into states of mind where I feel I cannot improve in one way or another, or cannot help someone else with something they have asked for. I try to offset the failure to help some by helping others in areas I feel more secure, but the regret from the failures linger.

### Q. 6.2
#### In what specific ways, small or large, do you think adopting some or all of these habits could change a person's personal and professional life?

> As stated before, I have the personal belief that I can always improve myself. This belief extends to every person, that they may always improve themselves too. By oberving some of these ideas, we may see our strenths in life and apply them to some of the most difficult problems we come across, and approach even the toughest choices with confidence.
> 
> At work, it may be supporting a coworker, or standing up to a problematic superior. Maybe your company wants to implement a business practice that you disagree with. Find a way to express your concerns. 
> 
> In our day-to-day lives it may be organizing ourselves, setting personal goals, or standing up for a friend - or even stranger - in need.

### Q 7.1
#### What might be the end goal fo an *ethical* life as a software engineer? What profesisonal goals or other valuable ends could a software engineer achieve by living well in the ethical sense? What personal goals or values could it help such a person achieve?

> Being an eithical engineer often means being conscious of worldly issues, be them political, economical, or environmental. For some, simply knowing that you helped ease such a problem is a goal in and of itself, but others might need a monetary incentive. Software often lends itself well to environmental issues, as we gradually enineer more time and energy efficient programs, algorithms, and solutions.
> 
> Electric vehicles are extremely energy efficient and will soon be an excellent economic choice for consumers, meaning large profit for the engineers behind them, on top of the pride gained from contributing to an environmentally friendly solution.
> 
> Many apps created today are designed to solve social or ecological issues, like the flooding in downtown Charleston. These apps are created by moral thinking minds, but need either political or entrepeneurial support to reach the market and end-user. A business-oriented mind can help market and monetize these apps to fund their creation and maintenance.

## Q. 8.1
#### Read over Appendix A and B. Identify two code items from Appendix A and two from Appendix B about which you would have - either: a question concerning its meaning, a commant aobut its importance, or a concern about its ability to be well implemented. Pose those questions/comments/concerns below.

> **A-1)** II a i: "If the engineers' judgement is overruled under circumstances that endager life or proerty, they shall notify their employer or client and such other authority as may be appropriate
> 
> Questions of ethics in software may be clear cut, but not well defined in legislation, and oft ignored by corporations. Two years ago it was discovered that Google was prividing AI for the military Drone Strike project. This may be considered an act that endangers life, and no doubt many Google employees saw it this way, and protested in response. But who are they reporting to? Their employer is the body overruling their judgement, and the client *is* the authority, and they have specifically ordered this overrule. 
> 
> **A-2)** II b: "Engineers shall perform services only in the areas of their competence."
>
> I get the point of this section, but do not personally like the wording. What is meant by competence? Is it asking if they can do the job at all, or if they have the proper qualifications? As worded, it seems to encourage stagnation, in that anyone who cannot do a certain action shall never be able to do said action, when in reality the best way to become competent at something is to *do* that *thing*. I concede this probably only applies to sensitive, professional settings, but then why have the code if to not follow it in a literal sense?
>  
> **B-1)** 4.04 "...Disclose to all concerned parties those conflicts of interest that cannot resonably be avoided or escaped"
> 
> Conflicts of interest are dubious subjects. Let's suppose an eningeer was working on a weapons system for a government contract. Their employer then secures a contract with an opposing government, and the employer expresses their concerns with this contract, but the employer keeps this contract anyway. Should the employer be freed of their spot on the project, or forced to work on it anyway? What if the company fires them outright? Regardless of whether the companies contract is ethical, what is an ethical solution for the employee's discomfort?
> 
> **B-2)** 8 "Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profesion and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.
>
> I appreciate how optimistic this wording is. In this section the text largely encourages the enineer to "always improve yourself" and "practice ethically". It encourages growth and praises the engineer for honoring the code. Contrast this with the NSPE reading, and you'll see a much different tone.

## Q. 8.2
#### How might the qualities of a 'superprofessional' engineer with practical wisdom, as described in this section, assist such a person in applying these codes successfully? Be specific.

> Most of the qualities listed seem to relate to self awareness in morals and responsibility. Both the NSPE and ACM/IEEE-CS codes focus largely on thse two topics, so it makese sense tha these 'superprofessional' qualities would aid in applying the codes.
> 
> Brutal honesty is especially important, since it often contradicts some common moral ideals, but risks compromising certain ethhical issues. Consider a "white lie" someone may tell another to protect their feelings. If the lie is about their skills, when they are working on a safety-sensitive project, they may continue working on the project without proper practice, potentially leading to major issues with the project later on.
