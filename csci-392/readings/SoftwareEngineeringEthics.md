***How can software engineers live up to their ethical obligations, both professioally and in their private lives?***

There are a number of common habits and practices that reate obstales of living well in the moral sense; fortunately, there are also a number of ocmmon habits and practices that are highly conductive to living well:

1. **Self-Reflection/Examination**  
This involves spending time on a regular basis (even daily) thinking about the person you want to become, in relation to the person you are today. It involves identifying character traits and habits that you would like to change or improve in your private *and* professional life; reflecting on whether you would be happy if those whome you admire and respect most knew all that *you* know about your actions, choices and character; and asking yourself how fully you are living up to the values you profess to yourself and others.

2. **Looking for Moral Exemplars**  
Many of us spend a great deal of our time, often more than we realize, judging the shortcoming of others. We wallow in irritation or anger at what we prerceive as unfair, unkind, or incompetent behavior of others, we comfort ourselves by noting the even greater professional or private failings of others, and we justify ignoring the need for our own ethical improvement by noting that many other seem to be in no hurry to become better people either. What we miss when we focus on the shared faults of humanity are those exemplary actions we witness, and the exemplary persons in our communities, that offer us a path forward in our own self-development. Exemplary acts of forgiveness, compassion, grace, courage, creativity and justice have the power to draw our aspirations upward; especially when we consider thhat there is no reason why we would be incapable of these actions ourselves. But this cannot happen unless we are in the habit of looking for, and taking notice of, moral exemplars in the word around us.

3. **Exercising our Moral Imagination**  
It can be hard to notice our ethical obligations, or their importance, because we have difficulty imaging how what we do might affect others. In some sense we all know that our personal and professional choices almost always have consequences for the lives of others, whether good or bad. But rarely do we try to really imagine *what it will be like* to suffer the pain that our action is likely going to cuase someone - or what it will be like to experience the joy, or relief of pain or worry that another choice of ours might bring. This becomes even harder as we consider stakeholders who live outside our personal circles and beyond our daily view. The pain of your best friend who you have betrayed is easy to see, and not difficult to imagine before you act - but it is easy *not* to see, and not to imagine, the pain of a person on another continent, unknown to you, whose life has been ruined by identity theft because you knowingly allowed a product with gaping security holes to be released without providing customers a patch. The suffering of that person, and your responisibility for it, would be no less great simply because *you* had difficulty imagining it. Fortunately, our powers of imagination can be increased. Seeking out news, books, films and other sources of stories about the human condition can help us to better envision the lives of others, evn those in very different circumstance from our own. This capacity for *imaginative empathy*, when habitually evercides, enlarges our ability to envision the likely impact of our action on other stakeholders. Over timme, this can help us to fulfill our ethical obligations and to live as better people.

4. **Acknowledging Your Own Moral Strength**  
For the most part, living well in the ethical sense makes life *easier*, not harder. Acting like a person of courage, compassion and integrity is, in most circumstances, also the sort of action that gerners respect, trust and friendhip in both private and professional circles, and these are actions that we ourselves can enjoy and look back upon with satisfaction rather than guilt, disappointment or shame. But it is inevitalb ethat osmetimes the thing that is right will not be the easy thing, at least not in the short term. And all to often our moral will to live well gives out *exactly* this point - under pressuer, we take the easy (and wrong) way out, and try as best we can to put our moral failure and the harm we may have done or allowed out of our minds.

5. **Seeking the Company of Other Moral Persons**

**What are the professional <u>codes</u> of software engineering ethics? How doe they acutally help us to be ethical in our working lives?**

Each professional socety of engineers adopts and enforces its own codes of practice, including codes for *ethical* practice; in Appendix A and B below we hav eincluded the codes of ehtics adopted by the professional societies most relevant to siftware enigneers in the United States: the NSPE (National Socitety of Professional Engineers) and the ACM/IEEE-CS (Asocciation for Computing Machinery/Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers Computing Society).

...

In describing the character of exemplary software engineers, one scholar identifies seven qualities of 'superprofessionals' who embody the highest ideals of their field:
1. a strong sense of individual responsibility
2. acute awareness of the world around them
3. brutal honesty
4. resilience under presure
5. a heightened sense of fairness
6. attention to detail while maintaining perspective
7. pragmatism in applying profesisonal standards
