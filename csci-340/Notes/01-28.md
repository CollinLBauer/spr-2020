- due Feb 6th

```
./hw3 wc HW3.c
   |
   V
   main(argc argv)

    argv ---> [-]--> "hw3"
              [-]--> "wc"
              [-]--> "hw3.c"

I missed some other detail here.

## Lottery scheduling
- Randomly select jobs based on tickets
- Number of tickets implies priority

"How to make it fair?"
- Strides and pass counts

Job 1 - 50 tickets  
Job2 - 25 tickets  
Job 3 - 25 tickets

For every time slice:
1. Pick random number between 0 -> (# tickets - 1)
2. Run job that owns that ticket

The number of tickets implies the priority of job
- Every job generally starts with the same number of tickets
- System can balance priority by changing # of tickets each job has

### How do we represent our list of tickets?

```
|--------------------------|-------|-----------|
             J1               J2        J3
list[r]

```

Accessing this array is O(1), but this is very memory heavy.  
Here's another method:

```
  50   25   25
|----|----|----|
  J1   J2   J3

v = 68          // Who owns ticket #68?
0 + 50 = 50     // 68 > 50; ticket not owned by Job 1
  + 25 = 75     // 68 < 75; ticket owned by Job 2
```

This is very light on memory, but it operates on O(n) time, where n = # of jobs

(A binary tree is another option.)

### Stride

- Jobs randomly selected per ticket
- Ticket is run; takes t.c. from a "stride"
- when stride is used up:
  - gets no more execution time until other processes finish their strides
  - time slices reset when all slices reach 0

```
t.s. = 48ms

|----------|----------|----------|
0    J1   100   J2   100   J3   100
|----|     |          | 
  48 |     |          |--|
     |     |--|        24|
     |      30|          |----|
                            48|

etc.
```

## Memory Management

Why virtualize memory?
- Transparency
- Efficiency
- Protection

### Early memory stack
```
+---------+     --
|   OS    |      | - Kernel mode
|---------|     --
| Program |      |
|         |      |
|         |      |
|         |      | - User mode
|         |      |
|         |      |
|         |      |
|         |      |
+---------+640kk --
```

### Static Relocation
```
+---------+     
|   OS    |     
|---------|64k  
|   P4    |     
|---------|128k 
|   P2    |     
|---------|192k 
|         |     
|   P3    |     
|         |     
|         |     
+---------+     
```

**Program Load**
- Relocation dictionary
- Adjust based on starting address

Downides
- Slow to relocate
- not transparent


*I zoned out for a bit...*

### Dynamic Relocation
```
+---------+     
|   OS    |     
|---------|64k  
|   P2    |     
|---------|128k 
|   P1    |     --> P1 base set to 128k
|---------|192k     - What happens when P1 is freed?
|         |         - if needed, P3 may be moved to P1's base at runtime
|   P3    |         - allows contiguous block of free memory below P3
|         |
|         |
|---------|
|  Free   |
+---------+     
```

How it works
- Base & Bounds registers
- Base register --> start of program
- Everything in program is relative to base register

Benefits
- Avoids memory fragmentation


### Memory Fragmentation

As we allocate memory, sections of memory get used. Eventually we decide to free thse allocations. But what happens with tiny "free" sections of memory are thrown between allocated portions?

***Garbage collection***
- dynamic reallocation for local heap
- pause main program execution
- shuffle allocated sections upwards
- all free blocks will be moved at bottom

The operating system does something similar for the same reasons
