### Memory Management, cont.

*Partial review from last class*


### 1: Single program loaded in memory

**Hardware requirements**
- kernel mode
- user mode

**OS Requirements**
- Fixed load; no relocation

Still used today in small embedded devices

```
+---------+     
| Kernel  |     
|---------|16k
| Program |     
|         |
|         |
|         |
|         |
|         |
|         |
|         |
+---------+
```

<br/>

### Multiple programs

**Hardware requirements**
- Memory protection
- Exceptions

**OS requirements**
- Static Relocation (table)
- Free space management
- Exception Handler

```
+---------+
|   OS    |
|---------|64k  
|   P2    |
|---------|128k 
|   P1    |     
|---------|192k 
|         |     
|   P3    |     
|         |
|         |
|---------|
|  Free   |
+---------+     
```

<br/>

### Base & Bound

**Hardware requirements**
- Base & Bounds registers  
  Each program has a base address & bound address
  - every program operates relative to its base address
  - program is limited to bound address
- Address translation & validation

**OS Requirements**
- Dynamic relocation
- Free space management
- Exception handler
- Move memory
- save/restore base/bound registers in context

```
+---------+
|   OS    |
|---------|64k  
|   P2    |
|---------|128k 
|   P1    |     --> P1 base set to 128k
|---------|192k     - What happens when P1 is freed?
|         |         - if needed, P3 may be moved to P1's base at runtime
|   P3    |         - allows contiguous block of free memory below P3
|         |
|         |
|---------|
|  Free   |
+---------+     
```

***Real Address***
- An address in the CPU's memory

***Virtual Address***
- An address the program sees

## Segmentation

What if an operating system wanted to move sections of a code elsewhere in memory?

"It is a whole lot easier to deal with a large number of small things than a small number of large things."


```
+-----+
|     | Code
|-----|
|     |
|  v  | Heap  <--- Segment
|-----|
|     |
|     | Free  <--- Segment
|     |
|-----|
|  ^  | Stack
|     |
+-----+
```

```
+----------+    ---->    +----------+
| Kernel   |             | Kernel   |
|----------|    ---->    |----------|
|          | 4k          | P2 Stack |
|----------|    ---->    |----------|
| P2 Code  |             | P2 Code  |
|----------|    ---->    |----------|
| P1 Code  |             | P1 Code  |
|----------|    ---->    |----------|
|          |             | P1 Heap  |
|----------|    ---->    |----------|
| P2 Heap  |             | P2 Heap  |
|----------|    ---->    |----------|
| P1 Stack |             | P1 Stack |
|----------|    ---->    |----------|
| P1 Heap  |             |          |
|----------|    ---->    |          |
|          |             |   Free   |
|----------|    ---->    |          |
| P2 Stack |             |          |
|----------|    ---->    |          |
|          |             |          |

                01-S2->Heap-01
                10-S3->Stack-10
```
<br/>

### Advantages of Segmentation
- Allows sharing of memory

Hazard: Unwanted access & changes
- Solution: ***permissions*** (read/write/execute)
- Rules of thumb:
  - Code should be read & execute
  - Heap shouldbe read & write

<br/>

### Segmentation Requirements

**Hardware Requirements**
- *missed something here...*
- Segment bits in address
- Address translation & validation
- Access control (rwx)

**OS Requirements**
- Dynamic relocation
- free space management
- moving memory
- save/restore *multiple* base/bound registers in context


Other considerations
- Moving memory is *expensive* and should be avoided when possible

<br/>

## Free Space Management (in the context of heaps)


Free list
- linked list (single or double)
- contains:
  - pointer to block of memory
  - size of block
  - *magic number*

Example:
- single 16k block
- char *x malloc(100)
  - pointer moves 100 bytes forward
  - size becomes 16k - 100
- free(x)
  - checks if "magic number" is still in-tact (see below)  
    *This isn't necessarily the best solution, but a very cheap one.*
  - OS knows exactly how much to give back to block
  
Example 2:
- 

```
Struct alloc-node {
    unsigned int SIZE;
    unsigned int magic_number;
}
magic_number = 0x1234567789ABCDEF; // some arbitrary clever number

```
