## Operating Systems

### Assignments
- Homework 3/4 due tonight
- Project 2 assigned
  - teams due February 13th  
    Up to you if you use the same team (probably)
  - assignment due March 3rd

### Project 2 - Paging Simulation

*CLI project*

Arguments
- size of computer memory to simulate
- size of a page in computer's memory
  - memory size must be even multiple of page size
- number of jobs to run
- the minimum and maximum run times for each job
- minimum and maximum memory needed for each job

Scheduling type: Round Robin

Jobs generated at start of simulator
- form a queue
- memory for the job will be ranimly selected between minimum and maxmum memory size specified on command line
- run time for the job randomly secete between minimum and maximum times (in time slices) specified on command line

...etc; full details on [Project 2 PDF]("../projects/Project 2.pdf")

### Hints from class

Project doees not need tobe built in C

Random
- Java  
  `import random`
  `random.seed()`
- Prime numbers make the best seeds

## Chapter 20 - Swapping

Key concepts
- Do we really need everything in memory?
- `mmap()`
- Memory is a cache of virtual pages
- Page faults
  - The present bit


He mentioned ***Overlays*** briefly, which seem to be a precursor to swapping.

### Swapping
- Disk backing virtual memory
- "Memory is just a cache of disk space."


Page table
```
                       ┌─── Present ─┬─ 1: in memory
Page table             │             └─ 0: on disk
┌─────────────────┬─┬─┬v┬─┬─┐
│PFN              │ │ │P│ │ │
├─────────────────┼─┼─┼─┼─┼─┤
│                           │
│                           │
│                           │
│                           │
│                           │
│                           │
└───────────────────────────┘
```

*I zoned out for a bit. Something about converting VM to disk files*


### Important parts of swapping
Where swap directions are specified
- disk
  - swap file (writeable)
  - executalbe (read-only)

### Mapping
Bash
- `pgrep program_name`
  - lists all process IDs with that name
- `pmap pid`
  - lists all related files in memory of specified process
  - common elements...
    - `[ anon ]` - typically the heap
    - `[ stack ]` - the stack
    - `libc-x.xx.xx` - used by almost every process in Linux


## The ELF-File format

Simple ARM code
- Header
  - ELF Header
  - Programmmmmmm Table
- Sections
  - Core
  - Data
  - Sectionnnnnn
- Header
  - Scerwarwaerjwaior Table

*He drew a very detailed drawing showing the general layout of the ELF format*

Pay special attention to the header. It says the architecture of the file and whether it is Big or Little Endian.


### Caching
Swapping data between memory levels
- L1
  - 1-3 cycles
- L2
  - 5-20 cycles
- Physical Memory
  - 100 cycles
- Disk?
  - Much, much longer

### Average Memory Access Time

<p style="font-size: 1.2em;">
T<sub>m</sub> ≈ 0.0000001s
<br/>
T<sub>d</sub> ≈ 0.01s
<br/>
<br/>
P<sub>H17</sub> = 90% = 0.9
<br/>
T<sub>m</sub> + ((1-P<sub>H17</sub> * T<sub>d</sub>))
<br/>
= 0.0000001 + ((1- 0.9) * 0.01)
<br/>
≈ 0.0010001 ≈ 1ms
</p>

Note: Microsoft does not use the ELF-format, but its own PE format.

**Thrashing** - Spending so much time swapping, no useful work gets done

<br/>

### Swap policies
- FIFO (queue)
- Random
- Least recently used (LRU)  
  Least frequently used (LFU)
  - needs context
  - Reference bit

***Reference bit***
- set to 1 if recently used
- wheen more room is needed, algorithm will check reference bit
  - if bit is 1, set to 0
  - if bit is 0, mark for "casting out"

***"Dirty" bit***
- set to 1 if it has been written to
- when swapping out:
  - if bit is 0, may be removed safely
  - if bit is 1, page must be written to memory/disk before removing
  - smart algorithm will look for a page that has not been written to to avoid writing to disk (very expensive)

See "clock" example

### Memory Pressure
- Low -> Excess memory
- High -> Over-committed

Test is coming up.
- Caching
- sum of the points exceed 100, but some questions may be hard
