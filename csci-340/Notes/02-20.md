## Operating Systems

Missed the first half hour of class. Dr. C was largely talking about critical sections of code.

The code sections that I have copied down are incomplete.

[Example on from projector](./examples/02-03/unguarded.c)

How to solve unguarding?
1. use a variable
   - doesn't work
2. disable interrupts
   - performance *(not sure if he means good or bad)*
   - side effects (missed interrupts)
3. spin locks
   - works
   - fair
   - poor performance
4.
   - works
   - fair
   - good performance



### Spin locks
Test and set (pseudocode)
- test variable, value
- if variable >= value:
  - set variable = value
  - return original value

```
lock(int v) {
    while(TestAndSet(v,1) != 0); //effectively does nothing
}
unlock(int v) {
    TestAndSet(v, 0);
}
```

### Yielding
```
lock(int v) {
    while(TestAndSet(v,1) != 0)
        yield(); // OS call
}
```

We also talked about treating structures as custom types
