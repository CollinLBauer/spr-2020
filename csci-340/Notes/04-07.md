   - 8) The mutex associated with the condition variable is unlocked if the process waits
   - 9) All of the above

   - 1) 

4. Short Answer
   - 3) Both work correctly. Spin lock without a yield is much more unfair and uses more performance.

   - 5) They are working with different data elements inside the queue.
