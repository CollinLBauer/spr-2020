## Operating Systems

30 minutes late. Traffic was terrible.  
But also I should've left earlier.

## Chapter 6 - Direct Execution

"How does a program interact with the operating system?"

**Kernel vs User modes**

***Microkernel Architecture***
- Minimum Kernel Mode
  - Process mode
  - Virtual memory
  - Device I/O

***System Calls***
- Traps
  - int instruction
  - 256 long table
  - system call
    -additional params
      - system call 1 or
      - as needed

<br/>

System calls are managed by tables setup 
on boot time.

***Boot Time***
- *OS*
  - Setup interrupt table
  - setup system call table

***Program Load setps***
- *OS*
  - Creates process list empty
  - Alllocated memory
  - Load program from disk
  - Setup kernel stack
  - Interrupt return
- *Hardware*
  - Restore/set
    - instruction pointers
    - stack pointers
  - Set machine to **user mode**

### Example

*What parameters are needed to open a file?*
1. path to filename
2. mode (read, write, execute)

Program function call
- call open()
  - COMPUTER LIBRARY
    - interrupt
    - syscall
    - open
  - HARDWARE
    - restore kernel rgisters
    - set kernel mode
    - branch target
    - .... systcall
    - ...
  - OS
    - validate *"Do you have authorizaton?"*
    - execute open()
    - issue interrupt return

UML

|USER PROGRAM| |COMPUTER LIBRARY| |HARDWARE| |OS|
|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
| Call open() | ==> |Interrupt instruction |
| | | syscall |
| | |open| ==> |Retrore kernel registers|
| | | | | Set kernel mode |
| | | | | Branch through interrupt/syscall table | ==> | Do open() |
| | | | | | | - Validate |
| | | | | | | - execute function |
| | <== | ---- | <== | ---- | <== | - issue interrupt return |

---

Boot time
- setup timer
- timer interrupt

Hardware
- Timer interrupt
- saves registers
  - io kernel stack
- branches through interrupt table

OS
- call switch() routine

Yeah I got a little lost here.

## Chapter 7 - Simple Scheduling

***Our Assumptions:***
1. Each job runs for the same amount of CPU time
2. All jobs sart atthe same time
3. All jobs run to completion
4. No I/o, CPU only
5. Each job runs for a known amount of CPU time

These assumptions are not realistic, but they help us understand the fundamentals.

**Scheduling policy**
- *"What are the rules?"*

**Job**
- *"unit of work*"
- run a program


***Metrics***
- Turn-around time  
<span style="font-size: 1.3em;">T<sub>turnaround</sub> = T<sub>completed</sub> &nbsp;â€“ &nbsp;T<sub>arrived</sub></span>

Example - FIFO queue

Job A - 10 seconds  
Job B - " "  
Job C - " "

```
0       10
|       |
|------>|
| Job A | Job B | Job C |
| 10s   | 20s   |
```
