## Operating Systems

I was late to class. Ashley Phosphate is cruel.

### Process API
- Create
- Destroy
- Suspend/resume
- Status


### Process S...s

```
                     i/o ==> SUSPEND ==> i/o completes ==> READY ==> dispatch ==> RUN
Initiate ==> Run ==> time or priority ==> READY ==> dispatch ==> RUN
                     process finishes ==> TERMINATE

```

### C Structures
- Map an area of memory to variables
- struct codes 
  - maps an area of memory
  - *[Example struct.c](./examples/struct.c) code reference*
    - field 1: 8 bytes (int)
    - field 2: 20 bytes (chararray)
    - next: 8 bytes (pointer to next structure)

### Implementing the API

1. Create
- fork()
  - process 1 is running
  - wants to createa child process
  - initializes a fork, a "clone of itself"
  - process 2 is created
  - `int pid = fork();`
    - The return value is the process ID
    - if the return value is 0, it is the child
    - if it is nonzero, it is the pid of the parent
  - [Example code p1](../Book/ostep-code/cpu-api/p1.c)
- wait()
  - waits for child to finish running
  - `int wc = wait(NULL);`
    - [Example code p2](../Book/ostep-code/cpu-api/p2.c)
- exec (family of functions)
  - "Execute"
  - replaces current program with new one
  - current program waits for new to finish???
  - `execvp(myargs[0], myargs);`
    - [Example code p3](../Book/ostep-code/cpu-api/p3.c)
    - [Example code p4](../Book/ostep-code/cpu-api/p4.c)

## Misc. notes

The sizes of variable types varies by the compiler creating the C program
- An int could be 2, 4, or 8 bytes. We will consider it 8 in class.

Null <=> (void*)0
