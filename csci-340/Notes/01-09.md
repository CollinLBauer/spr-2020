# Operating Systems

CSCI 340

Dr. Crosby

- Adjunct professor
- He works at NIWC.
- I like him so far.

### Day 1 checklist

- ~~Register to Slack channel~~
- Get a Linux VM running (virtualization is required for certain things.)
  - Just slap a fresh Ubuntu in your VMware; trash Lubuntu
- eBook
  - *Operating Systems - Three Easy Pieces*
  - http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/
- ~~Get a C compiler working~~ (GCC)
  - Many concepts are taught in C, but coding assignments may be done in any language that supports taught concepts.
- Get a working schedule

Other notes
- Projects will be donein groups of two
- Homework is done individually.

### Operating Systems

An **Operating System** is system software that manages computer hardware, software resource, and provides common services for computer programs.

*What does it do?*
- Controls software
- Bridge between ardware & apps
- Owns storage

Key points:
- Resource management
  - CPU/Storage/Devices
- Provides abstraction layer
  - Apps <--> Machine

Goals of the operating system:
- Efficiency
  - "It would be strange if the software monitor was a resource hog."
- Easy application coding
- RAS *(IBM)*
  - Reliability
  - Availability
  - Servicability
- Isolation
  - Multiprocessing
  - Applications don't bump into each other

<br/>

***Linux VM***
- Common environment
- Accessible
- "Kill and try again"

***C programming language***
- Pointers
- Simple syntax
- "Close to the metal"

Examples of C-related problems
- The null-terminated character
- Overwriting memory

<br/>

### Virtualization

"What do we virtualize?"
- "Pretty much everything."  
  CPU, storage, devices, etc.

C data types
- Char
- Short
- Long
- Byte
- etc.

### C code snippets

Pointers
```
int x[10]; // declare X as an array of 10 integers
int *x; // allocate pointer to an integer in varaible X

// note that an array *is* a pointer, and in fact, both above declarations behave very similarly. The first line declares a block of memory and points to that; not sure what the second line does really yet
```
