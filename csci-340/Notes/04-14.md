## Filesystems, cont.

### Filesystem components

1. Superblock
   - "geometry" of the filesystem
   - defines what the format of the file metadata is
2. Inode bitmap
   - which pages of the inode are in use?
3. Data bitmap
   - which pages of data are in use?
4. Inodes
5. Data

**Blocks**
- A block is a unit of storage. Think of it has the Hard Drive equivalent of a Page, which is related to memory.


### Example Inode

|Size|Name|What is this inode field for?|
|-|-|-|
| 2 | mode | Can this file be read/written/executed? |
| 2 | uid | Who owns this file? |
| 4 | size | How many bytes are in this file? |
| 4 | time | What time was this file last accessed? |
| 4 | ctime | What time was this file created? |
| 4 | mtime | What time was this file last modified? |
| 4 | dtime | What time was this inode deleted? |
| 2 | gid | Which group does this file belong to? |
| 2 | links_count | How many hard links are there to this file? |
| 4 | blocks | How many blocks have been allocated to this file? |
| 4 | flags | How should ext2 use this mode? |
| 4 | osd1 | an OS-dependent field |
| 60 | block | A set of disk pointers (15 total) |
| 4 | generation | File version (used by NFS) |
| 4 | file_acl | A new permissions model beyond mode bits |
| 4 | dir_acl | Called access control lists |


### Inode data pointers
- a set of disk pointers
- pointers may lead to a block of data, another block of pointers, or NULL.
  - block size is defined by the file system, typically 4096 bytes (NTFS)
  - data block size is rigid, but file may not use entire block
  - pointer block may point to data blocks, more pointer blocks, or a mix.
- not all pointers need to be used
- large files, thanks to nested pointers, acts as a tree-like structure


### Filesystem commands

***mount***
- mounts a filesystem
- must be done as root
- requires a mount point
- example
  - sudo mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt/media
