## Operating Systems

Today was a weird day. College was put on a trial lockdown in lieu of COVID-19, so our class took place remotely through something called Zoom. I had an audio issue for a second at the start.

## Sephamores and Pipelining

Uh... I kinda didn't pay close attention. *HOWEVER*, the slides and example code can all be found in `./examples/03-12/`

*(Some of the code he wrote on the fly; I do not have that.)*


## Pipelining

```
[Stage 1]   [Stage 2]     [Stage 3]
    \put     ^    \put     ^    
     v      /get   v      /get
     =Queue1=>    =Queue2=>  
```
