## Operating Systems

*I missed Tuesday's class. Should probably get notes from Rob, Garett or Terence...*

#### Housekeeping
- HW6 due tonight
- Project 3 assigned
  - Multi-Server Queue
    - multithreaded process that counts number of words in a text file
    - each thread leads a single line and parses the word count
    - "single producer/multiple consumer queue"
  - program must be thread-safe
  - Terence and I are coding in Rust.

## Queue


```
Head            Tail
  |              |
  |              v
  ---->[]------>[]

```

### queue methods
- put()
  - add a new element to end of queue
  - tail->next= new
  - tail = tail->next
- pop()
  - remove first element from the queue
  - temp = head
  - head = head->next
  - return temp
  - (temp must be garbage collected if no longer referenced)

### Design Patterns

See [example](./examples/03-05/Producer_Consumer.c)

1. **Pipeline**

A typical pipeline
```
  T1       T2       T3
┌────┐   ┌────┐   ┌────┐   
│    │-->│    │-->│    │
└────┘   └────┘   └────┘   
```

Multi-producer, multi-consumer pipeline
```
  T1       T2       T3
┌────┐       ┌────┐       ┌────┐   
│    │       │    │       │    │
└────┘\     ^└────┘\     ^└────┘
┌────┐ v┌─┐/ ┌────┐ v┌─┐/ ┌────┐   
│    │->│Q│->│    │->│Q│->│    │
└────┘ ^└─┘\ └────┘ ^└─┘\ └────┘
┌────┐/     v┌────┐/     v┌────┐   
│    │       │    │       │    │
└────┘       └────┘       └────┘
```

<br/>

2. **Semaphore**

```
sem_t my_sem;
sem_init(&my_sem, NULL, initial_value)

sem_wait(&my_sem);
//deincrement, if value <0 wait

sem_post(&my_sem);
//increment, dispatch one waiter
```

<br/>

3. **Lock**
- Basically, if the semaphore's value is less than 0, it will be "locked"

4. Orderiia?

```
MAIN:
    sem_t mySem;
    sem_init(&my_sem, 0, ?); // start thread
    sem_wait(&my_sem) // do something else
    

THREAD:
    // do stuff
    SEM_POST(&my_sem);
    // do more stuff
```

*I tried following his example code, but he was jumping around a lot. I gave up trying to copy it down.*


5. **Reader/Writer**
- can both read and write from a file
- only one process can write
- many processes can read
- cannot read and write at the same time
- uses semaphore locking to control these behaviors

*What happens if one of these threads crashes?*
- usually results in deadlocking (program freezes)
- There are ways to handle crashes.
